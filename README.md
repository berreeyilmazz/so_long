You are going to use the school graphical library: the MiniLibX! This library was
developed internally and includes basic necessary tools to open a window, create images
and deal with keyboard and mouse events.

• The player’s goal is to collect every collectible present on the map, then escape
chosing the shortest possible route.
• The W, A, S, and D keys must be used to move the main character.
• The player should be able to move in these 4 directions: up, down, left, right.
• The player should not be able to move into walls.
• At every move, the current number of movements must be displayed in the shell.
• You have to use a 2D view (top-down or profile).
• The game doesn’t have to be real time
